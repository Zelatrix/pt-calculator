# pythagoras_erl
This project contains a collection of functions for performing operations on right-angled triangles
The first function takes two integers a and b, and implements the Pythagorean Algorithm to produce a result that forms the hypotenuse of a right triangle. 
The second function determines whether the dimensions of a right-angled triangle form a Pythagorean triple.
